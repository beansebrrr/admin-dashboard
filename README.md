# üë§ Admin Dashboard

An Odin Project project.

This is a mockup dashboard written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ‚ùì What is this

This activity was taken from The Odin Project's intermediate course on HTML and CSS. Here, I get to utilize things I've learned from within and outside the course, with heavy focus on CSS grids and using it alongside other tools like Flexbox. 

## ‚ú® Output

I made a webpage wherein its layout relied heavily on CSS grids. I learned to acknowledge first-hand the benefits and drawbacks of CSS grids, which lets me know better when to and when not to use certain features to create a part of a webpage.
